## Compiling Notes

Writing computer code would be useless if the computer were not able to understand what the programmer was trying to express and compute accordingly. There are two main ways a piece of code, written in a programming language, gets translated to machine code that the computer can understand and execute.

The first method is interpretation. Scripting languages like Python are 'interpreted', meaning an interpreter is used. At a high level, an interpreter takes as input the source program and the program's input(s) and outputs the program's output. The interpreter goes line-by-line through the program with the program's input. Interpretation trades generality for specificity. Each time you want to run a program with an input, the program is translated again. This gives interpreted languages a more dynamic awareness at the cost of upfront safety.

```
sayhello.py:
```

```python
import sys
print(sys.argv[1]) # argv[0] is the invoking program ('python')
```
 
```
> python sayhello.py 'hello world'
hello world
```
 
The second method is compilation. Languages like C, C++, and Java are all compiled languages, meaning a compiler translates the source code. A compiler takes a source program as input and outputs an executable program. That program can then be run with input as desired. This is why each time you change the source code, you must re-compile to produce a new executable. The compiler examines the entire program as it produces the executable, giving compilers a deeper (more forward) understanding of the program. This trades on-the-fly decisions for generality and safety enforcement. Each time you want to run a program with an input, you run the executable with that input.

```
SayHello.java:
```

```java
package example;
public class SayHello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);
    }
}
```

```
> javac -d . SayHello.java
> java example.SayHello 'hello world'
hello world
```

Let's take a deeper look at what we just did.

`SayHello.java` holds a class `SayHello`. In Java, the file name and class name must match exactly, consequently there is only one (public, outer) class per file.

We give the source program to the compiler, `javac`. You'll notice the first line of the program specified the class is in the example package. All of our programs will be part of a package. This keeps common code under the same roof. Note that a package lies at the java level, it is not necessary for `SayHello.java` to be in a folder (directory) named `example`, though this is sometimes a convention. The `-d .` is an option given to `javac`. It says the directory to put/find the package is `.` and recall from the Shell Notes that `.` is a shorthand that the shell gives us to refer to the current directory we are in. The last argument to `javac` is the name of the source file(s) to compile.

`javac` then outputs the compiled files. This is always the name of the file (class) with the extension `.class`. You'll notice that our directory now contains a new directory, `example`. This is the name of the package and holds the compiled files. When we invoke `java`, we tell it where to find the compiled files. We must also tell `java` the entry point of our code, i.e. where to start execution. This is the package-qualified name of the class that holds the main method you want to run, in our case `example.SayHello`. The last argument is our input to the `SayHello` program.

A word about executables
------

With Java, the notion of executables is a bit different than with that of C and C++. One of the reasons Java took off back in the day was that it targeted a virtual machine, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM gives way to Java's slogan "write once, run anywhere". With C and C++, the compiler translates your code to the specific architecture of your machine. The executable it produces is only guaranteed for that architecture. To go to a different machine, you'd need to re-compile on the new machine. With Java, it targets the JVM so anyone that wants to run your Java program just needs a JVM. This is the common 'architecture'. Thus, you can distribute the compiled java files and clients can run that without portability issues.
